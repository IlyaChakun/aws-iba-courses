consensus algorithms Paxos, Raft, ZAB, Pacifica

Symmetric/leader-less: Here, all servers participating in the consensus have equal roles. So the client can connect to
any one of the servers in this case. Example: Paxos.
Asymmetric/leader-based: Here, at any given time, one server acts as the leader apart from those participating in the
consensus. The rest of the servers accept the leaderâ€™s decisions. Here, clients can only communicate with the leader.
Example: Raft, ZAB.




Cassandra implemented Paxos for their lightweight transactions. Kafka internally uses Pacifica, whereas Zookeeper and Hazelcast use ZAB and Raft, respectively
