2. Copy the Object URL and paste it into a new tab.
3. Go back to the Bucket and click the Permissions tab.
4. Scroll down to the Bucket Policy and click on Edit button.
5. Copy and paste the below policy and save the policy. Don't forget to change the bucket ARN with your bucket ARN in
   the Resource option in the code.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Resource": "<YOUR_BUCKET_ARN>"
    },

   in your S3 bucket with the CloudFront domain name.

### Restricting the Geographic Distribution of Your Content

1. On the distribution settings page, select `Geographic locations` tab and click on `Edit` button.

## Understanding CloudFront Origin Groups

### Make the objects publicly accessible

1. Click the `Permissions` tab to configure your bucket.
2. In the Permissions tab, Edit the `Bucket Policy`.
3. You will see a Blank policy editor.
4. Copy the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of your bucket to the clipboard. It is displayed at the top of the policy editor.
   It looks like ARN: `arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name`.
5. Update the bucket ARN on the `Resource` key-value in the policy below and copy the policy code.
6. Click on `Save changes`.

Here's the bucket policy:

```json
{
  "Id": "Policy1",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "replace-this-string-with-your-bucket-arn/*",
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Creating CloudFront Distribution

1. Select `CloudFront` under Networking and Content Delivery from the Services menu.
2. Navigate to the left side and select `Distributions` tab.
3. Click on the `Create distribution` button.
4. Configure distribution as follows:
    - **Origin Domain Name**: On click of input space, select your S3
      bucket: [name]
    - For `Web Application Firewall (WAF)` select `Do not enable security protections`.
5. Keep rest things as default, scroll down and click on the `Create Distribution` button.
6. After 10â€“15 minutes, you can see the `Deploying` status changed and the last modified time is present. The domain
   name that Amazon CloudFront assigns to your distribution appears in the list of distributions.
7. Copy and paste the domain of CloudFront distribution in the new tab of your browser and add `/index.html` in the URL.
   It should display the index.html page present in the S3 bucket.

### Launching an EC2 Instance

* Create Ec2 with SG for port 80 from anywhere
* Userdata:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y           
yum install -y httpd        
systemctl start httpd           
systemctl enable httpd          
echo "<h1>Hello, this index.html page from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html
echo "<h1>Hello, this index2.html page from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index2.html
chmod 644 /var/www/html/index2.html
systemctl restart httpd         			
```

### Add EC2 as the Origin and create Origin Group

1. Before adding EC2 Instance as Origin, make sure CloudFront distribution is having `Enabled` status.
2. Once the CloudFront distribution is having `Enabled` status, click on the `ID` to add the origin.
3. Switch to the `Origins` tab and click on the `Create origin` button.
4. In the first option `Origin domain`, paste the copied Public IPv4 DNS of EC2 Instance. All the details of the Origin
   domain will be listed below.
5. For `Protocol`, select `HTTP Only`. Keep all the options as default and click on the `Create origin` button.
6. Now there are two origins present.
7. Go back to the `General` tab, you will see these changes are getting deployed. Wait for 5-10 minutes until you see
   the `Deploying` status changes and the `Last modified` time is present.
8. Switch to `Origins` tab and scroll below and click on the `Create origin group` button.
9. Select the Public IPv4 DNS of EC2 Instance and click on the `Add` button.
10. Similarly, select the S3 Bucket endpoint and click on the `Add` button.
11. Once both the Origins are added, give a name as `dev-Origin-Group` in the next field.
12. For the failover criteria, Select `404 Not found` error code present.
13. Once done, click on the `Create origin group` button. The Origin group is now created.
14. Go back to the `General` tab, you will see these changes are getting deployed. Wait for 5-10 minutes until you see
    the `Deploying` status changes and the `Last modified` time is present.
15. Now Switch to the `Behaviors` tab. Select the present behavior and click on the `Edit` button.
16. On the `Edit behavior` page, for the `Origin and origin groups` option, select the present Origin Group
    i.e. `dev-Origin-Group` from the dropdown.
17. In `Cache key and origin requests`, select `CashingOptimized`.
18. Scroll to the end of the page and click on the `Save changes` button. The default cache behavior is now updated to
    the Origin group.
19. Go back to the `General` tab, you will see these changes are getting deployed. Wait for 5-10 minutes until you see
    the `Deploying` status changes and the `Last modified` time is present.
20. Now you can test the origin group.

### Test the Origin group

1. Copy the Distribution domain name and paste it into the new tab of your browser. This should now display the
   index.html page from EC2 Instance as it has the Private IP DNS name.
2. Now add `/index.html` into the URL. This displays the contents of the index.html file present in the S3 Bucket.
3. Now update the URL by changing `/index.html` to `/index2.html`.
